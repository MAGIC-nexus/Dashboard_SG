# Draft of the dashboard UI for SHALE GAS case study (ms, June 2019)

# This is a Shiny web application. You can run the application by clicking
# the 'Run App' button above.
# based on https://github.com/mammykins/App-cherry_picker 
# This app should be used to develop your own dashboard with map as a Shiny app
# It provides a good skeleton to start from.

library(shiny)
library(leaflet) # required to render maps
